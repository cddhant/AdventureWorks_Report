# AdventureWorks_Report
This project encompassed the complete development of an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to effectively transform raw data into professional-quality reports and dashboards to track KPIs, compare regional performance, analyze product-level trends, and identify high-value customers.
This comprehensive project involved several key stages, including data preprocessing, robust data modelling, DAX calculations, and visually engaging data visualization.

# Key Achievements:
### 1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Cleansed and transformed raw data, ensuring accuracy and consistency.
   - Eliminated errors and inconsistencies to enhance data quality.

### 2. Data Modeling:
   - Employed a combination of snowflake and star schema techniques to normalize and organize data.
   - Established explicit relationships between various tables, promoting efficient querying.
   - Integrated multiple fact tables and dimension tables to create a coherent database structure.

### 3. DAX Calculations:
   - Developed custom DAX measures and calculated columns to facilitate intricate calculations and minimize data redundancy.
   - Implemented a dedicated "Measures" table to house and manage the array of measures created (up to 15 measures).
   
### 4. Visualization and Dashboard Design:
   Designed a multi-page dashboard to cater to different user needs.
**i. Executive Dashboard:** Showcased key performance indicators (KPIs), revenue trends, monthly revenue, and top products for executive-level insights.
**ii. Customer Details Page:** Utilized a variety of visualization tools, charts, and matrices to present in-depth customer-related data.
**iii. Product Detail Page:** Enabled drill-through functionality to delve into specific sub-product information from the Executive Dashboard.
**iv. Geospatial Visualization**: Created an interactive map with a slicer for continent selection to visualize sales data geographically.

Through data processing, intricate modeling, and innovative visualization techniques, I successfully transformed raw data into actionable insights. This interactive Power BI dashboard serves as a powerful tool for the company to monitor performance, identify trends, and optimize sales strategies, ultimately contributing to improved business outcomes.
